      <h2>Experiences gained over the years</h2>
      <br>
      <h4>Tutoring</h4>
      <br>
      I have had the pleasure tutoring CXC students Physics, Maths and English since 2005 to present.
      <br><br>
      <h4>Lab Assistant</h4>
      <br>
      Coming from a scientific background, I have work for 5 years as a Lab Assistant
      at the bauxite company in Linden. This has broaden my knowledge of dealing with chemicals in an industrial setting.
      <br><br>
      <h4>Coding</h4>
        <br>
      Never in my wildest dream did I consider being a programmer. However, writing codes using different programming languages
      has occupied more than 80% of my time for the past two years. As a result a career as a programmer is becoming more and more of a possibility to me.
